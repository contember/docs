### Using custom palettes in Contember admin

You can add generated CSS custom properties in your project in simple 3 steps.

1. Use pallet generator below to get CSS custom properties.
2. Create `custom-theme.css` in `admin` folder your project and insert generated CSS custom properties.
3. Import `custom-theme.css` file in `/admin/index.tsx`. You need to import this file under `import '@contember/admin/style.css'`.

You can edit and modify each of the color palettes below and override the shipped palletes by appending the generated CSS properties after the import of the `@contember/admin` styles in your admin styles file, e.g. `src/admin/index.sass`. Only the colors that differ from original colors are generated for overrides.

The generated palletes provide sufficient contrasts for both dark and light themes according to the [upcoming APCA standard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/silver/wiki/Visual_Contrast_of_Text_Subgroup#WCAG_2.x_to_Silver.2FAPCA_Comparison_Table).

You can change highlights, middles and the shadows by unlinking the color inputs and changing colors independently. This will help you achieve expected color tones.
