# Directives

Directives are React components that can be used to pass values (even rendered) to upper context
and control your app from within the pageâ€”**to direct it what to do**, hence the name.

:::tip You can render as many directives as you want, **the last one rendered wins**.
This principle ensures the ability to **override the value of a directive from within
any nested component.**

You can use `Title` component that uses directive to control the title of your page at any nesting depth.
You can render default `Title` component in the root of your route and override it in any nested component.
:::

## 1. Setting values with directive in the page

To use a directive that will push value to the parent context just render the `Directive` component with the `name` and `content` props.

```tsx title="admin/pages/example.tsx" {3,7,12}
import * as React from 'react'
import { CommonSlots } from '@contember/layout'
import { Directive, Title } from '../components/Directives'

export default () => (
	<>
		<Directive name="title" content="Page Title" />
		<p>Some content</p>

		<div>
			<p>Nested content</p>
			<Directive name="title" content="Override Page Title" />
		</div>
	</>
)
```

## 2. Creating Directives

To create a directive, you need to use the `createDirectiveContext` factory function.

:::tip
To make the usage of directives easier, you can create a shorthand component. For example, you can create a `Title` component that will render the `Directive` component with the `title` name.
:::

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="admin/components/Directives.tsx" metastring="{1,13,16-18}">
	{_components_DirectivesSource}
</CodeBlock>

## 3. Applying the directives in the layout

To use the directives in the layout, you need to use the `useDirectives` hook.

```tsx title="admin/components/Layout.tsx" {1,4,9}
import { useDirectives } from "../Directives"

export const Layout = ({ children: pages }: React.PropsWithChildren) => {
	const directives = useDirectives()

	return (
		<>
			<main>
				<h1>{directives.title}</h1>
			</main>

			{pages}
		</>
	)
}
```
