# <span className="version">Interface 1.2+</span> Layout overview

Contember comes with flexible and declarative layout controls to render content in any layout you want.
And control layout from within any rendered page â€” introducing **Slots** and **Directives**.

:::note Slots and Directives are available in Contember Interface version 1.2.
:::

```tsx title="admin/pages/example.tsx" {3,4,6,10,12-14,16-18,20-22}
import * as React from 'react'
import { Button } from '@contember/admin'
import { Directive } from '../components/Directives'
import { Actions, Content, Sidebar } from '../components/Slots'

const { Actions, Content } = CommonSlots

export default () => (
	<>
		<Directive name="title" content="Example Page" />

		<Actions>
			<Button>Done</Button>
		</Actions>

		<Content>
			<p>Some content</p>
		</Content>

		<Sidebar>
			<p>Some sidebar content</p>
		</Sidebar>
	</>
)
```

## Slots

Slots are components built upon the React portals and they let you render content
in predefined places of the layout.

## Directives

Directives are components that let you pass even rendered values to the upper context
giving you the ability to control your app.
