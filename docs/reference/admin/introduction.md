Contember provides a wide range of components that you can use to build your administration interface. Some of the key components that are available in Contember include:

- `<DataGridPage>`: This component is used to create a page that displays a list of data. You can use this component to show a list of entities, such as blog posts or products, and provide features like sorting, filtering, and pagination.
- `<EditPage>`, `<CreatePage>`: These components are used to create and edit a page. You can use this component to show the details of an entity and provide fields for editing the data.
- `<Repeater>` component that you can use to create repeating sections in your forms. This component allows you to specify a set of fields that should be repeated, and then provides a user interface for adding and removing repeating sections.
- `<TextField>`, `<DateTimeField>`, `<CheckboxField>`, `<SelectField>` and many others: everything you need to build your interface.
