| Workspace                                                      | Your (git) repository with one or more Contember projects.                                                                                   |
| [Content API](/reference/engine/content/overview.md)           | This is the primary GraphQL API for your project, which is automatically generated from your schema definition.                              |
| System API                                                     | This is a supplementary API for your project. It's primarily used to manage schema migrations. You need it only in really advanced usecases. |
| [Tenant API](/reference/engine/tenant/overview.md)             | This API allows you to manage users, API keys, and project memberships on an instance.                                                       |
| [Project Schema](/reference/engine/schema/overview.md)         | This is the definition of your model, ACL rules, and input validation rules.                                                                 |
| [Project Migrations](/reference/engine/migrations/overview.md) | These are chronologically sorted, files that contain all schema or content changes. They serve as the source of truth for a schema.          |
| Event                                                          | Every operation performed on your data is stored in an event log. This log can be utilized to track history.                                 |
| Superadmin                                                     | This is a special user role within Contember. The Superadmin has the highest level of system access and control.                             |
