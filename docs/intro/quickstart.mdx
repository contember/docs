## Create new project with Contember

In this tutorial we will show you how to setup both Contember Engine and Contember Interface to create your first project.

:::note Prerequisites

- Installed [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) version 7+
- Installed [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) version 1.27+

:::

```bash
npm exec "@contember/create@latest" quickstart
```

It will create a new folder with basic Contember setup. After it is done:

```bash
cd quickstart
```

And then install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

And you're ready to go. Just start Docker containers and Contember will be running.

```bash
npm start
```

Now, project interface should be running on address [http://localhost:1480](http://localhost:1480).

:::note Started services

- Your application at [http://localhost:1480](http://localhost:1480)
- API endpoints at [http://localhost:1481](http://localhost:1481) (you can authorize with token `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`)

For advanced use-cases there is also:

- Adminer database management tool at [http://localhost:1485](http://localhost:1485).
- Minio local S3 provider at [http://localhost:1483](http://localhost:1483) (you can sign in with contembeer / contember credentials).
- Mailhog testing SMTP at [http://localhost:1484](http://localhost:1484).
- PostgreSQL database at [localhost:1482](localhost:1482) (you can sign in with contember / contember credentials).

## Create first project

From the first step you should have a folder structure that looks like this:

```
your_project_name/
  ├── admin/
  │   ├── components/
  │   ├── pages/
  │   ├── .env.development
  │   ├── .env.production
  │   ├── index.html
  │   ├── index.tsx
  │   ├── tsconfig.json
  │   ├── vite-env.d.ts
  │   └── vite.config.ts
  ├── api/
  │   ├── migrations/
  │   ├── model/
  │   ├── index.ts
  │   └── tsconfig.json
  ├── docker-compose.yaml
  ├── documentation.md
  ├── package.json
  └── tsconfig.json
```

## Create your first data model

First you have to tell Contember Engine, how your data model looks like. The `init` command automatically created `api/model/index.ts` file, so go there.

Here you start defining your project schema. Really simple example looks like this:

```ts title="api/model/index.ts"
import { SchemaDefinition as def } from '@contember/schema-definition'

export class Article {
  title = def.stringColumn()
  content = def.stringColumn()
}
```

1. Import `SchemaDefinition` so you'll get TypeScript autocompletion.
2. Define your first entity - `Article`. For this example let's just add two columns named `title` and `content`, both are `string`.

Then you need to generate a database migration for Contember Engine:

```bash
npm run contember migrations:diff add-article
```

:::note Contember CLI

`npm run contember` is a Contember CLI, if you call this without any arguments you'll see all the available commands.
We'll use `migrations:diff` command. It goes through your schema and generates migration - instructions for Contember how to get from previous state to your new one.
This command needs two parameters: first is name of your project (`quickstart` in our example) and then name your migration. It can be anything you want.

:::

Run this command and choose an option `Yes and execute immediately`. It will create your migration and after confirmation execute it. Now if you would look into your database, you would see there a table `article` with three columns: `id`, `title`, `content`. Nice.

## Create your administration UI

Now we have something we want to edit in UI. Let's start by adding a listing page for our articles.

### Add listing page

Go to `admin/pages` and create new file `articleList.tsx`.

```tsx title="admin/pages/articleList.tsx"
import * as React from 'react'
import { DataGridPage, TextCell } from '@contember/admin'

export default () => (
  <DataGridPage entities="Article" rendererProps={{ title: 'Articles' }}>
    <TextCell field="title" header="Title" />
  </DataGridPage>
)
```

1. Import `@contember/admin` package for TypeScript autocompletion.
2. Export page component as default export.
3. Use `DataGridPage` component to show the data in a simple datagrid.
4. Tell it which entities you'd like to edit. In our case it's `Article` (it has to be the same name we used in the model).
5. Use `TextCell` to add text column.

If you go to [localhost:1480/article-list](http://localhost:1480/article-list) you'll see list of your articles. Which is empty as we didn't add any data there yet.

Let's add some data.

### Add create page

```tsx title="admin/pages/articleCreate.tsx"
import * as React from 'react'
import { CreatePage, RichTextField, TextField } from '@contember/admin'

export default () => (
  <CreatePage entity="Article" rendererProps={{ title: 'Create Article' }}>
    <TextField field="title" label="Title" />
    <RichTextField field="content" label="Content" />
  </CreatePage>
)
```

1. We'll create a new file named `articleCreate.tsx`.
2. This time we'll use `CreatePage` component.
3. We'll tell it what we want to add (`Article`).
4. We'll use two new components - `TextField` and `RichTextField` and tell them what fields to edit.

Now at [localhost:1480/article-create](http://localhost:1480/article-create) you can create new article. And if you go to the [list of articles](http://localhost:1480/article-list) you'll see the data are there.

But it doesn't work very well. One of the things missing is to go to edit mode after you created a new article. So let's start by adding an edit page:

### Add edit page

We'll create a new page named `articleEdit`. It looks almost the same as the create page - but we have to tell it which article to edit:

```tsx title="admin/pages/articleEdit.tsx"
import * as React from 'react'
import { EditPage, RichTextField, TextField } from '@contember/admin'

export default () => (
	<EditPage entity="Article(id = $id)" rendererProps={{ title: 'Edit Article' }}>
		<TextField field="title" label="Title" />
		<RichTextField field="content" label="Content" />
	</EditPage>
)
```

Let's use it. We'll redirect users from our create page to the edit page after the article is successfully created:

```tsx title="admin/pages/articleCreate.tsx"
import * as React from 'react'
import { CreatePage, RichTextField, TextField } from '@contember/admin'

export default () => (
  <CreatePage
    entity="Article"
    rendererProps={{ title: 'Create Article' }}
    {/* highlight-start */}
    redirectOnSuccess="articleEdit(id: $entity.id)"
    {/* highlight-end */}
  >
    <TextField field="title" label="Title" />
    <RichTextField field="content" label="Content" />
  </CreatePage>
)
```

This is done with `redirectOnSuccess` prop where we specify link to page where user should be redirected.

Now if you create a new article you're automatically redirected to the edit page.

What's missing is an edit and delete button in the list of pages.

```tsx title="admin/pages/articleList.tsx"
import * as React from 'react'
import { DataGridPage, DeleteEntityButton, GenericCell, Link, TextCell } from '@contember/admin'

export default () => (
  <DataGridPage entities="Article" rendererProps={{ title: 'Articles' }}>
    <TextCell field="title" header="Title" />
    {/* highlight-start */}
    <GenericCell shrunk><Link to="articleEdit(id: $entity.id)">Edit</Link></GenericCell>
    <GenericCell shrunk><DeleteEntityButton immediatePersist /></GenericCell>
    {/* highlight-end */}
  </DataGridPage>
)
```

1. We've added two `GenericCell`.
2. First with `Link` component targeting `articleEdit` page and passing `id` as parameter.
3. Second with delete button provided by `DeleteEntityButton`.
4. Minor touch is use of `shrunk` with tells the cell to be as small as possible.

### Add pages to side menu

One last thing is to add our pages to the left sidebar:

```tsx title="admin/components/Navigation.tsx"
import * as React from 'react'
import { Menu } from '@contember/admin'

export const Navigation = () => (
  <Menu>
    <Menu.Item>
      <Menu.Item title="Dashboard" to="index" />
      <Menu.Item title="Articles" to="articleList" />
      <Menu.Item title="Create new article" to="articleCreate" />
    </Menu.Item>
  </Menu>
)
```

And that's it! You have just created a simple data model and created custom interface, so you can edit the data.

## Fetch data via GraphQL API

We recommend reading [Content API topic](/reference/engine/content/overview) however if you're looking to quickly play with the API, we've prepared [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) project for you to import and quickly try it out. To use it <a href="/assets/insomnia-quickstart.json" target="_blank">download it here</a> and just drag&drop it to Insomnia.
