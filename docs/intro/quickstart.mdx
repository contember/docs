```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

In this tutorial we will show you how to setup both Contember Engine and Contember Admin to create your first project.

:::note Prerequisites

- Installed [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) version 6+
- Installed [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

:::

## Step 1: Install and run Contember

```bash
npm init @contember quickstart
```

It will create a new folder with basic Contember setup. After it is done:
```bash
cd /quickstart
```
And then install dependencies:

<Tabs
defaultValue="windows"
values={[
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
    {label: 'Mac', value: 'mac'},
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>

```bash
npm i
```
<br/>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mac" label="Mac">

```bash
docker-compose run admin npm i
```
We recommend to install dependencies directly in Docker

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

```bash
npm i
```
<br/>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then just
```bash
docker-compose up
```
