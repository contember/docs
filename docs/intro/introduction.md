Contember is an open-source platform designed for rapid development of data-driven web applications.

## What is Contember

With Contember, you can structure your data models using TypeScript and Contember Engine will instantly provide a GraphQL API for your data. Meanwhile, Contember Interface, a React framework, enables you to build bespoke user interfaces with high-level React components in hours.

Behind the scenes, Contember takes care of technical aspects like generating a well-structured PostgreSQL database, handling automatic database migrations, and providing a built-in authentication and powerful role-based access control list. This means you can concentrate on building your application, rather than getting lost in setup and configurations.

Whether you're developing on your own or as part of a team, Contember makes it easy to build custom backends, headless CMSes, customer relationship systems, employee portals, or other management apps.

:::tip New: Contember Studio

Meet Contember Studio, an AI tool that rapidly turns your brief app description into a working prototype on the Contember platform. From there, you have complete freedom to modify every detail in the code to suit your needs. Contember Studio is an effortless way to kickstart your projects and get feedback on day one.

## Why we build Contember

Building custom web apps is more challenging than necessary, particularly for small teams or individual developers tasked with maintaining complex code bases over time. At Contember, we're challenging this status quo.

We envision a world where everyone can become a full-stack developer, and where backend and frontend specializations aren't prerequisites for creating robust applications. Our declarative framework is central to this vision. But we're pushing boundaries even further with Contember Studio, an innovative AI tool that allows users to craft a functional first version of their app in mere minutes. This allows developers to focus on what really matters: creating apps that solve problems and delight users.

Although the expanding complexity of web development allows for building remarkable things, it comes with a cost. Our goal at Contember is to simplify, streamline, and democratize web app development. We're here to empower you to build the web apps you need, and to bring the joy back into the building process.
