title: Contrasts Chart

import { Chart } from "../../../src/theming"

*(Internal documentation page)*

The chart below represents all the contrasts (orange and pink) between the generated luminance values (blue, scaled from 0-1 range to 0-100).

- blue: luminance values
- light green: `Chroma.scale().correctLightness()`
- light blue: Polynomial scale
- red: luminance values in (customized) log scale
- orange: sets of contrast against the darker color background
- pink: sets of contrast against the lighter color background
<!-- - green: offsetting curve (unused) that pushes the luminances a bit in the middle -->

Findings:

1. When the resulting contrast sets are flat, the luminance steps in the dark areas are too big
1. `Choma.scale()` with distributed luminance provides great granularity in dark areas, however lacks in higlights;
1. Polynomial scale provides great balance, but the granularity is not enough;
1. The reverse APCA method provides a good baseline for the luminance scale...
1. ... but distribution of luminance needs to be modified (final version)
